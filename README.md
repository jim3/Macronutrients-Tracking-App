### Macronutrients Tracking App

Converting the [Macronutrients-Tracking-App-VanillaJS](https://github.com/jim3/Macronutrients-Tracking-App-VanillaJS) app to a Node.js & Express application.

I'll continue to convert this project as the other project progresses. As opposed to the other project I'll be adding more features to this app, like a MongoDB database, 
possibly user authentication, and hopefully more as I learn more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo   
`git clone  https://github.com/jim3/Macronutrients-Tracking-App.git`

2. Install NPM packages
`npm install`

3. Run the app
`npm start` or `node server.js`

## Usage

1. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
